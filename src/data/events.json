      "description": "Parenting is hard-especially for families navigating anxiety. Today's parents face an overwhelming volume of advice shaped by rigid cultural ideals of what \"good\" parenting looks like, particularly when it comes to managing children's fears and worries. How do you raise resilient children in an age of uncertainty? How do you parent effectively when you yourself are anxious? Much of the advice parents encounter, unfortunately, encourages responses that can increase the long-term risk of anxiety in children. In trying to protect kids from discomfort, well-intentioned parents may block experiences children need to build courage, confidence, and resilience.\n\nIn her new book Parenting Anxiety: Breaking the Cycle of Worry and Raising Resilient Kids, Meredith Elkins, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, brings clarity to this increasingly urgent conversation. Drawing on her clinical work with children and families-and her own experience as a parent-Dr. Elkins helps parents rethink so-called \"negative\" emotions such as fear, sadness, and guilt, and understand how modern parenting pressures contribute to anxiety in both children and adults. She encourages families to clarify their values and adopt a \"love and limits\" approach-balancing compassion with healthy boundaries while resisting the urge to shield children from every discomfort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n LINKS \n *  Event Page",
