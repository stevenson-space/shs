## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Setting up your .env file
Duplicate the `.env-template` and rename the duplicate to `.env`. This will keep the template, and give you a personal development environment that won't get commited to github.
